# CS_361_Assignment_2

The entire purpose for this assignment was to create a repo, that's why there's nothing here. If you want the actual work that I did for CS_361 see [Terminal Chess](https://github.com/Benjamin-Anderson-II/Terminal-Chess) (The course project) and [Basic_TUI](https://github.com/Benjamin-Anderson-II/Basic_TUI) (The microservice I made for my teammate)
